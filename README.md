# dragon_shouts_translator_app

Its about Elder Scroll: Skyrim. English language translating to the Thu'um or dragon shout.

## Know about language
Dragons are able to master and use their Thu'um at will, as this sacred language is their natural language, inborn into their souls from the moment of their creation (when dragons shout, breathing fire or frost at each other with the Thu'um they are actually having a deadly verbal debate).
